A tree, not binary tree!!!
(full binary tree = perfect binary tree)
(complete binary tree: as far left as possible)
(BST: no duplicate nodes)

Node store associative keys(string) and values
Root is associated with empty string
一般没有duplicate
Descendants have a common prefix
Children可以是一个vector,里面每一个元素是一个pointer
如果是数字的话children是10个,如果是字典的话children是26/52个

应用: auto complete

Height: length of the longest key
Search time complexity: O(n) n=height
Insert time complexity: O(n) n=height
